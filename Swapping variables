## 1. Swap Variables in One Line
In most languages, you need a temporary variable to swap values. In Python, you can do it in one line:

```python
x = 5
y = 10

x, y = y, x

print(x) # 10
print(y) # 5

### Tip #2: String Reversal
*Commit Message suggestion:* "Added string reversal slicing trick"

```markdown
## 2. Reverse a String Quickly
You don't need a loop to reverse a string. You can use slice notation with a step of -1.

```python
my_string = "Hello World"
reversed_string = my_string[::-1]

print(reversed_string) # dlroW olleH

### Tip #3: The 'enumerate' function
*Commit Message suggestion:* "Added enumerate example for loops"

```markdown
## 3. Use enumerate() instead of range(len())
If you need both the index and the value in a loop, use `enumerate`.

```python
names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]

for index, name in enumerate(names):
    print(f"{index}: {name}")


---

### Tip #4: List Comprehensions
*Commit Message suggestion:* "Added list comprehension syntax"

```markdown
## 4. List Comprehensions
You can create a new list based on an existing list in a single line.

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squares = [n**2 for n in numbers]

print(squares) # [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

### Tip #6: F-Strings
*Commit Message suggestion:* "Added f-string formatting example"

```markdown
## 6. F-Strings for Formatting
Introduced in Python 3.6, f-strings are the cleanest way to insert variables into strings.

```python
name = "Dev"
points = 8

print(f"Hello {name}, you have {points} points.")

---

### Tip #7: Merging Dictionaries
*Commit Message suggestion:* "Added dictionary merge operator"

```markdown
## 7. Merge Dictionaries (Python 3.9+)
You can merge two dictionaries easily using the `|` operator.

```python
dict_a = {"x": 1, "y": 2}
dict_b = {"y": 3, "z": 4}

merged = dict_a | dict_b

print(merged) # {'x': 1, 'y': 3, 'z': 4}


---

### Tip #8: Removing Duplicates
*Commit Message suggestion:* "Added set trick to remove duplicates"

```markdown
## 8. Remove Duplicates from a List
The fastest way to remove duplicates is to convert the list to a `set`, then back to a list.

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]
unique_numbers = list(set(numbers))

print(unique_numbers) # [1, 2, 3, 4]


---

### Tip #9: Zip Function
*Commit Message suggestion:* "Added zip function example"

```markdown
## 9. Zip Two Lists Together
You can iterate over two lists at the same time using `zip`.

```python
names = ["Anna", "Bob"]
ages = [25, 30]

for name, age in zip(names, ages):
    print(f"{name} is {age} years old")


---

### Tip #10: Context Managers
*Commit Message suggestion:* "Added file handling with context managers"

```markdown
## 10. File Handling with 'with'
Always use the `with` statement when opening files. It automatically closes the file even if there is an error.

```python
with open("test.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("Hello World")
# File is automatically closed here
